## Product Requirements

### Problem Statement
Henry has two kinds of users, **providers** and **clients**. Providers have a schedule where they are available to see clients. Clients want to book time, in advance, on that schedule.

**Providers**

- Have a schedule
    - On Friday the 13th of August, I want to work between 8am and 3pm.

**Clients**

- Want to reserve a 15m time ‘slot’ from a providers schedule.
    - Reservations expire after 30 mins if not confirmed.
    - Reservations must be made at least 24 hours in advance.
- Want to be able to confirm a reservation.

## Task

Build the front end for a mobile web application that covers as many of the following as possible in the time allotted:

- Allows providers to submit times they’d like to work on the schedule.
- Allows clients to list available slots.
- Allows clients to reserve an available slot.
- Allows clients to confirm their reservation.
